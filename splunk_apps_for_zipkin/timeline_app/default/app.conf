description = This custom visualization app contains a timeline that can be used throughout the product. A timeline visualization shows activity time intervals and discrete events for a resource set. Activity for each resource appears in a separate timeline lane. If an activity start time and duration are available for a particular resource, the timeline shows a duration interval as a horizontal bar in the lane. If only the start time is available, the timeline shows a circle at that time.
